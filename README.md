# **IoT**

Azure IoT Hub lets you connect, monitor, and manage billions of IoT assets. Azure IoT Edge is a fully managed service built on IoT Hub that allows for cloud intelligence deployed locally on IoT edge devices.

**SaaS** - Azure IoT Central is a fully managed SaaS app that makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage IoT assets at scale.

## **Overview**

**Establish bidirectional communication with billions of IoT devices** - Use device-to-cloud telemetry data to understand the state of your devices and define message routes to other Azure services without writing any code.

**Send and acknowledge** - In cloud-to-device messages, reliably send commands and notifications to your connected devices and track message delivery with acknowledgement receipts.

**Support for occassionally connected** - Device messages are sent in a durable way to accommodate intermittently connected devices.

**Authenticate per device** - For security-enhanced IoT solutions.

**Set up individual identities and credentials for each of your connected devices** - Help retain the confidentiality of both cloud-to-device and device-to-cloud messages.

**Ability to revoke access** - To maintain the integrity of your system, selectively revoke access rights for specific devices as needed.

**Automate IoT device provisioning and registration to accelerate your IoT deployment** - Speed up your IoT deployment by registering and provisioning devices with zero touch in a secure and scalable way.

Hybrid Scenarios - Take advantage of IoT Edge to make hybrid cloud and edge IoT solutions a reality. 

Enable artificial intelligence - and other advanced analytics at the edge, reduce your IoT solution costs, ease development efforts, and operate devices offline or with intermittent connectivity.
